This repository is intended to provide visitors of my personal website with a glimpse of my background and a few highlights from my CV. It serves as a brief overview of my experience, skills, and projects rather than a comprehensive record.

For my full and detailed CV, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly via the email address available on the website — I'll be happy to share it with you!
