   abstract = {Supersonic vacuum generators, or ejectors, operate pneumatically to extract air from tanks in industrial applications. A key performance metric for ejectors is the Total Evacuation Time (TET), which measures the time required to reach minimum pressure. This research predicts TET using empirical models that rely on two key metrics: the characteristic curve, which relates absorbed flow rate to the working pressure, and the polytropic curve, which describes the evolution of the polytropic coefficient across working pressures. Accurately capturing both curves for subsequent fitting to polynomial curves is crucial for forecasting TET. Several experimental setups were employed to capture the curves, each of which refined the data and improved the quality of the polynomial fits and coefficients. Multiple setups were necessary to pinpoint the breakpoint, from supersonic to subsonic operation mode, which is a critical factor that affects the characteristic curve and the TET. Furthermore, the research shows an improvement in the TET forecasts for each setup, with deviations between experimental and predicted TET ranging from 7.6% (14.5 s) to a 1.4% (2.6 s) in the most precise setup. Once the models were validated, an optimized ejector design, extracted from an author’s previous article, was tested. It revealed a 4% improvement (8 s) in the TET. These results highlight the importance of the mathematical models developed, which can be used in the future to compare ejectors and reduce the need for experimental data.},

The generation of those neutrons is driven by stripping reactions between energetic deuteron particles and a liquid lithium jet. The requirements on the deuteron beam are to deliver a 40 MeV with a constant current of 125 mA. All the systems involved in the generation, acceleration, transport and shaping of the deuteron beam are grouped in the so-called Accelerator Systems (AS). The design of this high-power driver has been ongoing for a long time, and many prototypes of the critical technologies have been tested. During the last decade, the design has been consolidated and evolved to an engineering design ready for construction. The overview of the main features of the design and the current status is presented in this article},

   abstract = {IFMIF-DONES (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility- DEMO-Oriented Neutron Early Source) - a powerful neutron irradiation facility for studies and certification of materials to be used in fusion reactors - is planned as part of the European roadmap to fusion electricity. Its main goal will be to characterize and to qualify materials under irradiation in a neutron field similar to the one faced in a fusion reactor. The intense neutron source is produced by impinging deuterons, from high-power linear deuteron accelerator, on a liquid lithium curtain. The facility has accomplished the preliminary design phase and is currently in its detailed design phase. At the present stage, it is important to have a clear understanding of how the commissioning of the facility will be performed, especially the commissioning of a 5 MW CW deuteron beam, together with the lithium curtain and the beam optimization for the neutron irradiation. In this contribution, the present plans for the hardware and beam commissioning of the accelerator will be given, focusing on the most critical aspects of the tiered approach and on the integration of the procedure with the lithium and test systems.},

This field is created by the interaction of a high energy intense continuous deuteron beam and a flowing liquid lithium target. The requirements imposed on the beam at the interaction point are a complex trade-off among the scientific experimental needs for the materials irradiation defined at the top-level requirements (20 dpa in a volume of 0.3 dm3 and 50 dpa in 0.1 dm3), and the technical constraints of several systems such as the Accelerator Systems, the Lithium Systems, and the Test Systems. Recent simulations with the initial definition of beam-on-target requirements showed the necessity of redefining them in order to fulfill the irradiation needs. This contribution will address the main challenges to gather the inputs for the definition and reassessment of the beam-on-target requirements. A comparison detailing the main changes compared to the previous ones will be given, together with a short overview of the studies ongoing by different systems to analyze the impact of each beam-on-target requirements on the performance of the whole facility.},

Other radiation sources will also arise due to the interactions between deuterons and the beam facing accelerator components. These radiation fields may cause some negative effects, such as damage to equipment or the generation of residual radiation sources. The characterization and mitigation of all the radiation sources are crucial for a safe operation and maintenance of the facility. In this study, the optimization and/or implementation of some radiation shields located in critical areas is considered to reduce the doses during operation and shutdown. Three scenarios are assessed: (i) shielding optimization of the High-Power Beam Dump for the accelerator commissioning, (ii) shielding optimization for the scraper of the High Energy Beam Transport line and the Fast Safety Isolation Valves, and (iii) shielding implementation to reduce the radiation transmission through Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning wall penetrations. Radiation maps of the biological dose and the dose to silicon are computed, showing the impact of such shielding elements.},

   abstract = {IFMIF-DONES will be an irradiation facility based on a 40 MeV deuteron accelerator. Unavoidable beam losses along the accelerator result in deuterium interactions with the beam facing materials of the vacuum beam pipe, some of them leading to material activation. The initial design of the beam pipe was based on stainless steel, but an evaluation of the residual doses from the pipe showed high values after operation of the accelerator. The accelerator beam line must be periodically maintained, and excessive cooling times for reaching acceptable dose levels may result in poorer availability of the facility. A deeper study of the High Energy Beam Transport line (HEBT) showed that a direct reaction between deuterons and iron in steel resulted in the production of Co-56, with a half-life of 77 days. This radioisotope is the main source of the radiation and makes it impractical to wait for a proper attenuation of the radiation field. A redesign of beam line elements has been performed to avoid the presence of stainless steel as a beam facing material and to replace it with aluminum where possible, resulting in faster decay of residual doses. This work contains a summary of the nuclear analysis performed for the computation of residual doses with stainless steel beam pipe, stressing the uncertainties of the calculations, based on the limited availability of nuclear data for the relevant nuclear reaction Fe56 (d,2n). The proposed replacement of element materials is also described, and an updated nuclear analysis shows the reduction of residual radiation, and its impact on possible maintenance operations.},

   abstract = {IFMIF-DONES (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility – DEMO Oriented Neutron Source) is a fusion materials testing facility that is currently being designed under the framework of a work package of the EUROfusion Consortium. It will use a 125mA at 40MeV deuteron beam to generate a high neutron flux through Li(d,xn) stripping nuclear reactions in a liquid lithium target. The High Energy Beam Transport line (HEBT), the most upstream system of the IFMIF-DONES accelerator, is responsible for the guidance and shaping of the beam towards the target. Additionally, during commissioning periods, the HEBT is also responsible for diverting the beam, through the Beam Dump Transport Line, to the Beam Dump for testing purposes. The HEBT is spread along different rooms and zones: the Accelerator Vault, the Radiation Interface Zone (RIZ), and Target Interface Room (TIR). The engineering design of the HEBT components situated within the TIR and RIZ has been updated to satisfy new requirements, with a focus on ensuring the protecting of the Fast Isolation Valve (FIV) from the backscattered radiation from the target. These modifications include relocating the FIV from the TIR to the RIZ, adjusting the building layout to accommodate the new FIV module, configuring an enclosure cabinet for the RIZ, and adding local shielding to extend the lifetime of the FIV seal actuators. This work describes the current status of these TIR and RIZ engineering design, including radioprotection, commissioning and maintenance plan, beam diagnostics devices, beam dynamics and new remote handling approaches, as well as the layout and integration of the required components along the beamline. The TIR and RIZ are critical areas for IFMIF-DONES, and their design and operation must be compliant with functional, reliability and safety requirements. The updated design addresses potential issues and enhances the facility’s overall functionality.},

The objective of the present paper is to mesh and simulate, in an OpenFOAM environment with an open access implicit density-based solver HiSA, the physics of the vacuum ejector, and, later, compare the results with experimental measurements. In order to achieve this a 2D axisymmetric mesh made by hexahedral cells has been created. Steady solutions have been obtained, with prescribed total pressure in primary and secondary inlets. Secondary total pressure ranges from 1 to around 0.2 bar in which the secondary flow is zero. Numerical results are compared with experimental measurement, with two flowmeter sizes for small flow rate accuracy. Two regimes are encountered. In supercritic regime the secondary is chocked and sonic flow is reached in the second nozzle. In subcritic regime, the secondary flow is subsonic. The agreement is good, although simulation tends to slightly overestimate flow rate for large values region.},

   abstract = {A vacuum supersonic ejector is an indispensable pneumatic device placed in nearly all industrial production lines. This device, also called a zero-secondary flow ejector, is characterized by the maximum entrained flow and the minimum secondary pressure. Numerical simulations were carried out by means of the CFD toolbox OpenFOAM v8 and its solver HiSA, which uses the AUSM+up upwind scheme. A single-factor analysis of eight parameters was performed to find how the ejector&rsquo;s performance was enhanced or decreased, while other parameters were fixed. Four parameters were subject to further analysis to find the geometry that improves the standalone performance of the ejector. The mixing chamber length is the parameter that most improves its performance; alone it leads to a 10% improvement. A multi-factor analysis, based on a fractional factorial design, is carried out with the four relevant parameters. Results indicate that the multi-factor analysis enhances the performance of the ejector by 10.4% and the mixing chamber length is the factor that most influences the improvement. Although a multi-factor design improves the performance, no significant relevance has been detected with respect to the mixing chamber length improvement alone. The improved performance of this device leads to a reduction in operating time and, as a consequence, results in significant energy savings.},
